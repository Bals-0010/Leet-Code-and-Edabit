"""
Create a function that takes a string and returns the number (count) of vowels contained within it.

Examples:
count_vowels("Celebration") ➞ 5
count_vowels("Palm") ➞ 1
count_vowels("Prediction") ➞ 4

Notes:
a, e, i, o, u are considered vowels (not y).
All test cases are one word and only contain letters.

    txt = txt.lower()
    count = 0
    for i in txt:
        if i in vowels:
            count = count+1
    return count

print(count_vowels("celebration"))
